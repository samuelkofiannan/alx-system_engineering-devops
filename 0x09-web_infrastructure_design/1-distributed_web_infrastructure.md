### Design of Distributed Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

#### Components:

1. **Server 1 (Web Server - Nginx):**
   - Manages HTTP requests and serves web pages.

2. **Server 2 (Application Server):**
   - Executes application logic and handles user requests.

3. **Load Balancer (HAproxy):**
   - Distributes incoming traffic among servers for load balancing.

4. **Application Files (Code Base):**
   - Contains the code for the website/application.

5. **Database (MySQL):**
   - Stores and manages data for the website/application.

#### Explanation:

- **Justification for Additional Elements:**
   - **Load Balancer:** Enhances performance, scalability, and reliability by distributing traffic.

- **Load Balancer Distribution Algorithm:**
   - Configured with Round Robin algorithm for equitable request distribution.

- **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:**
   - **Active-Active:** Both servers handle requests concurrently.
   - **Active-Passive:** One server is active while the other serves as standby for failover.

- **Primary-Replica Database Cluster:**
   - Primary node manages write operations, while Replica node(s) replicate data for read operations.

- **Difference between Primary and Replica Nodes:**
   - Primary node handles write operations and data updates, while Replica nodes replicate data for read operations.

#### Issues:

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
   - Potential SPOF if the load balancer or a server fails, impacting website availability.

- **Security Concerns:**
   - Lack of firewall exposes servers to security threats.
   - Absence of HTTPS encryption compromises data security during transmission.

- **Lack of Monitoring:**
   - Absence of monitoring tools impedes real-time performance and issue detection.

This design presents a distributed web infrastructure for www.foobar.com, detailing the function of each component, distribution algorithm, setup variations, database cluster, and potential infrastructure challenges.
