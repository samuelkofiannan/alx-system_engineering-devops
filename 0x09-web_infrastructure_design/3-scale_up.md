To address the question on scaling up the web infrastructure by separating components like web server, application server, and database onto their own servers, here is a breakdown of the components and explanations as per the requirements:

### Scaling Up Web Infrastructure Design

#### Components:
1. **Server 1 (Web Server):**
   - Dedicated to serving web content and handling HTTP requests.

2. **Server 2 (Application Server):**
   - Responsible for executing application logic and processing user requests.

3. **Server 3 (Database Server):**
   - Manages data storage and retrieval for the website/application.

4. **Load Balancer (HAproxy):**
   - Configured as a cluster to distribute traffic across multiple servers for load balancing.

#### Explanation:
- **Additional Elements Justification:**
   - **Web Server:** Separating web server functionality improves performance and scalability.
   - **Application Server:** Dedicated server for application logic enhances processing efficiency.
   - **Database Server:** Isolating database operations ensures data integrity and performance.
   - **Load Balancer Cluster:** Distributes traffic evenly across multiple servers for improved performance and redundancy.

- **Web Server vs. Application Server:**
   - **Web Server:** Serves static content and handles client requests.
   - **Application Server:** Executes dynamic application logic and processes user inputs.

#### Specifics:
- **Web Server Role:**
   - Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and communicates with clients.
  
- **Application Server Role:**
   - Executes application-specific logic, processes dynamic content, and interacts with the database.
  
- **Database Server Role:**
   - Stores, retrieves, and manages data for the application securely.

- **Load Balancer Cluster:**
   - Improves scalability by distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers in the cluster.

By separating components onto dedicated servers and utilizing a load balancer cluster, this design enhances performance, scalability, and reliability of the web infrastructure.
