### Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure Design for www.foobar.com

#### Components:

1. **Server 1 (Web Server - Nginx):**
   - Handles HTTP requests and serves web pages securely.

2. **Server 2 (Application Server):**
   - Executes application logic and processes user requests securely.

3. **Server 3 (Database Server - MySQL):**
   - Stores and manages data securely for the website/application.

4. **Firewalls (3):**
   - Secure the network by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.

5. **SSL Certificate:**
   - Enables HTTPS encryption to secure data transmission between clients and servers.

6. **Monitoring Clients (3):**
   - Collect data for monitoring services like Sumo Logic to track system performance and security.

#### Explanation:

- **Additional Elements Justification:**
   - **Firewalls:** Protect servers from unauthorized access and potential threats.
   - **SSL Certificate:** Encrypts data to ensure secure communication between clients and servers.
   - **Monitoring Clients:** Collect data for monitoring services to track system performance and security.

- **Firewalls Purpose:**
   - Control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to enhance security.

- **HTTPS Traffic:**
   - Ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during transmission.

- **Monitoring Importance:**
   - Tracks system performance, identifies issues, and ensures security compliance.

- **Monitoring Data Collection:**
   - Monitoring tools collect data on system metrics, logs, and events for analysis.

- **Monitoring Web Server QPS:**
   - Monitor web server QPS by tracking request rates and server response times.

#### Issues:

- **SSL Termination at Load Balancer Level:**
   - Termination at the load balancer exposes decrypted data, potentially compromising security.

- **Single MySQL Server for Writes:**
   - Single point of failure if the MySQL server fails, impacting write operations.

- **Identical Server Components:**
   - Lack of diversity in server components may lead to uniform vulnerabilities and limited redundancy.

This design outlines a secured and monitored web infrastructure for www.foobar.com, explaining the role of each component, the importance of security measures like firewalls and SSL, monitoring for performance and security, and potential issues with the infrastructure.
